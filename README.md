# Particles

Model description:

1. All particles have a "mass" and hence gravitate to each other.
2. Being close enough particles can collide and become a bigger particle (with cumulative mass).
3. When the mass of the particle reaches the critical value, the particle explodes into smaller particles.
4. The universe is finite, so that the particles cannot leave its boundaries.
